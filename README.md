## About

Single page app built with Javascript and jQuery.

http://pizza-builder.bitballoon.com/

Features:

- users can choose size, cheese amount, and toppings for a pizza, and view its updated cost
- users can add and delete pizzas from a shopping cart and see the total cost update
- users can view details for previously added pizzas

Note: I made a small commit after the deadline - just added a css property position:absolute to the pizza detail popups to make them stop pushing the neighboring pizza down. I would have branched, but I think it'll make it easier to review.

## Usage

To use the app, open pizza.html in your browser. Choose some toppings and add
a couple of pizzas to the cart to get started.
